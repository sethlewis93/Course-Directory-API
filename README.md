# COURSES DIRECTORY API

## About

REST API using Express & Node on the server, Seqeuelize as the ORM, and Postman for testing. This API mocks a school database which contains information about users and courses. 

Users can interact with the database to create new courses, retrieve information on existing courses, and update or delete existing courses. 

In order for changes to be made, users must be authenticated, thus the API will enables users to create a new account or retrieve information on an existing account.
